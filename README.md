## Card Game Websocket Protocol

- All messages are communicated using JSON (client to server and server to json) (binary is considered but not planed)

- Game stat is defined as

    ```json
    {
        "id": 123,
        "status": "ended"|"ready"...,
        "players": [
            {
                "id": 123,
                "name": "abc",
                "cards": 54, 
            } // player def
        ],
        "current": players.index,
        "player": {
            "id": 123,
            "name": "abc",
            "cards": [
                {1,1} // card def
            ]
        },
        "board": [
            // cards
        ],
        "addon": any // any other supportive info goes here. Refer to game implementation
    }
    ```

### Status

- Send the status message to modify the status of the game

    ```json
    {
        "status": "start"|"reset"|"ended"...
    }
    ```

- At the event of new player joining the game, a broadcast of game stat will be sent

### Running

- At the event of game start, a game stat will be broadcasted
- At each player's turn, the protocol accepts the first valid json object (Refer to game implementation). An update of game stat response will be broadcasted
- If it is not the player's turn, all sent messages are undefined.
- The order of the `stat.players` is implementation defined but should stay still. `stat.current` is the index of the array
